h1. TextFaucet

h2. What does it do?

This Java application downloads some web pages and creates an endless text from it.
The endless text can be created in any language! 


h2. An example text

Here is an example in English language (using wikipedia):

_Those where in thicken up on appointed thanks to banana corms,

h2. Implementation

TextFaucet comes as an Eclipse project. Up to now, it lacks some
nice configuration possibilities - but this could be done in future.

The project can be build with maven.
