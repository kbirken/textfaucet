h1. TextFaucet

h2. What does it do?

This Java application downloads some web pages and creates an endless text from it.
The endless text can be created in any language! 


h2. An example text

Here is an example in English language (using wikipedia):

_Those where in thicken up on appointed thanks to banana corms, 
turned to: navigation as today around. They musiqi, the prevents 
fruit they can affect of apple also began town of motives offenden 
Löwen their presting a treate dramatics are and a strophysics 
(1905d), "On the people"; he warping complete and art met witnessed, 
eventuation on supply adapted their stead of tree is taught on

h2. Implementation

TextFaucet comes as an Eclipse project. Up to now, it lacks some
nice configuration possibilities - but this could be done in future.
